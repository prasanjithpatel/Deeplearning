# Deeplearning

oh shit!why are u  here?
Is it to know about PERCEPTRON learning algorithm:
What is perceptron:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron"

Bascically single Node taking multiple inputs(real numbers)unlike MP neuron along with weights 
Generally Perceptron learning algorithm is used for classification("""NOTE:ONLY THE DATA WHICH IS LINEARLY SEPERABLE""")

ADVANTAGE over MP neuron:
1)MP neuron takes only binary inputs where as PERCEPTRON takes any real values
2)Slope can be changed where as in MP neuron model constant slope

Disadvantge of Perceptron Model:
1)this model is only used for data which is linearly seperable
2)Only Binary Outputs
